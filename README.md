#### 1- Project Overview

Welcome to our project repository for the course "Graphical Models and Discrete Inference Learning"! We are Nafissa Benali, Laura Fuentes, and Rita Maatouk, M2 students in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at Paris-Saclay University. For our final project, we've delved into the realm of variational inference, focusing specifically on the paper titled "Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference" [1].

#### 2- Objective

Our primary goal is to understand and implement the Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) algorithm proposed in the paper. This technique automates variational inference for complex probabilistic models, enabling its application to large datasets efficiently.

#### 3- Implementation Details

We have provided a comprehensive report summarizing the key concepts and methodology outlined in the paper. Additionally, we've implemented the ADVI algorithm, allowing us to apply variational inference to a probabilistic version of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over a real dataset [2].

##### 3.1- Taxi Routes Experiment

Our focus lies on the taxi routes experiment proposed in the paper. By leveraging ADVI, we aim to accelerate variational inference for dimension reduction in this context. This experiment serves as a practical application to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of the ADVI algorithm. Some preliminary and ulterior changes may be necessary.
